    <h1>Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Fried rice is a quick and flavorful dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with vegetables, eggs, and your choice of protein like chicken, shrimp, or tofu. 
        The combination of soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil gives it a savory and slightly smoky taste that’s both satisfying and comforting. 
        It’s a perfect way to use up leftover rice and turn it into a delicious meal.

    <p>
        The beauty of fried rice lies in its versatility—you can add almost any ingredient you have on hand, from peas and carrots to bell peppers or even pineapple for a sweet twist. 
        Each spoonful delivers a mix of textures, from the soft grains of rice to the crunchy vegetables. Serve it hot as a main dish or a side, and enjoy its simple, homemade goodness.
