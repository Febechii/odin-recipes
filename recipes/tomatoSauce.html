    <h1>Tomato Sauce Recipe</h1>
    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Tomato sauce is a rich, savory base made by simmering ripe tomatoes with onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano. 
        The slow cooking process allows the flavors to deepen, creating a smooth, tangy, and slightly sweet sauce that can be used in countless dishes. 
        A splash of olive oil adds extra richness, while salt and pepper bring everything together.
    </p>
    <p>
        This classic sauce is incredibly versatile and pairs perfectly with pasta, lasagna, pizza, or even as a dipping sauce. 
        You can customize it by adding vegetables, chili flakes for heat, or a touch of sugar to balance acidity. 
        Homemade tomato sauce not only tastes fresher but also fills your kitchen with a warm, comforting aroma.
